     <h2>Artificial Intelligence in Games</h2>
     <div class="ParagraphTexts"> 

        <div id="ChessColor" style ="background-color:#19323c;"> 
        <p>Nowadays, even games uses Artificial Intelligence technology. The simplest game that uses Artificial Intelligence is chess. When we play with a bot, the bot is actually an Artificial Intelligence robot because it analyses our move and it picks the best move. The probability of a human to win against an Artificial Intelligence bot in chess is very low. The last person to even win against an Artificial Intelligence chess bot was in 2008 when Hikaru Nakamura defeated Rybka bot.</p>

        <p>Did you know, the idea of having a machine playing chess against a human existed since the late 18th century? It started as a hoax where an author and inventor, Wolfgang von Kempelen unveiled a machine of his making called “The Mechanical Turk” to woo Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. However, the machine that he made was actually a lie because there was an operator inside it. Although it is a hoax, it still was a pioneer to the idea of having a computer playing chess against a human</p>

        <p>The person who developed the first algorithm for chess was a British computer scientist and mathematician, Alan Turing. He was famous for cracking the intercepted encrypted messages from the Nazis during World War II. After the war, he designed the first chess engine to run on a computer that didn't exist yet.</p>

        <p>After that, his former undergraduate colleague, David Gawen Champernowne and Alan Turing himself designed the heuristic algorithm, Turochamp and tried to run it on a 1951 Ferranti Mark 1 computer, but were unable to do so because of limited computational power. However, they implemented it manually on a chess board</p>

        <p>Claude Shannon, Alan Turing's former cryptoanalyst colleague noted in his paper that there are two common ways of representing a chess board.</p>

      <h2>Piece-centric Representation</h2>
      <div id="RepresentationText">
      <p>In this method, the computer keeps a list of all the pieces and their occupied squares.</p>

      <h2>Board-centric Representation</h2>
      <div id="RepresentationText">
      <p> In this method, the computer keeps a list of all the squares and the pieces that are occupying them or not. This was the representation that Claude Shannon preferred in his paper. Although it is not the most efficient encoding of a position, it was more convenient for calculations.</p>

    Because each position can be represented as the result of a previous position and a move, any chess program has an interest in searching through a directed graph to find the best moves.
We can see how the initial position can yield a limited number of moves, and as the tree grows deeper, move after move, so do the number of different positions available:

        <p> Moreover, now there are even non-playable character (NPC) that uses Artificial Intelligence technology to carry out dialogues with the player or even other non-playable characters. For example, the game The Matrix Awakens uses this concept for their game.</p>

            <p>In addition, Artificial Intelligence even made it to E-sports competition. In 2019, there was an E-sports competition between OG and OpenAI in Dota 2. OpenAI won a best-of-three series against The International Champion 2018, OG at a live event in San Francisco. </p>
                <p> 
                    OpenAI Five plays a simplified version of the game, with a limited subset of its heroes and without a few game features such as summons (where the player creates and controls additional units) and illusions (where the player can create copies of themself). The OpenAI researchers pointed out that excluding summons and illusions actually helps the humans because controlling the detailed movements of lots of units is the kind of thing AIs are very good at.</p>
