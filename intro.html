<p>Hello, we are Starbees from TL10. 
Our group members are Muhammad Nur Aizad bin Murtadha (1221109241), Imayanilavan A/L Shunmugam (1221108964) and Danysh Muqhreez bin Harudin (1221107494)

<p>The title for our case study is Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) Benefit Human in the Future. 
The reason we chose this specific title is because ever since chatGPT became used widely,
the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has evolved and became more accessible to the public. 
For example, there are even song covers that use AI technology to pretend the song is being sung by someone else</p>
